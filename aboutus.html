<p id="para2">Hello Readers!!! I'm Shreeya Khade. The sole passion that kept me motivated during the making of this project was to provide easily available books. I myself, being an avid reader, know the struggles of finding a soft copy of a particular book that I desperately wanted to read. So we came up with the idea of providing reading material without any prior subscription/fee. I have handled the Front End part of the project using HTML, CSS and JQuery.
